# Intro

## Prelude

This is not a "**Super Awesome Get-Rich-Quick Guide To Coding**".

This guide is meant to serve as a decently thorough tutorial for learning to code. This guide will implicitly fall into the trap of being 'yet another' of its kind, though if you're looking for another guide because the popular ones have failed you, then maybe this one will help :). If there is anything that can be done to make this better, feel free to contact me via ![email][email].

The first part will focus on the general syntax of most languages you might encounter. There are many different kinds of coding languages out there each created for a different *way* to program. A language's style can make it easier to solve different kinds of problems (which is why there are so many). For now, it would make more sense to worry about getting down the most basic fundamentals. Just like in natural languages, such as English, you must first learn the alphabet, words, and grammer to construct sentences. From there, more complex ideas can be expressed with paragraphs, then expanded into papers, which can even further reference each other to form a body of complex, but still expressible, knowledge. But first, we start small.

## But Which Language Should I Learn?

There are many languages that are good for different reasons, but the fundamentals between many of them are the same. Becuase of this, *multiple* languages will be learned at the same time. Yay! Coding is a skill honed with time. It needs to be slept on. Learning multiple languages at the same time, slowly, will really drive the fundamentals home.

The languages that will be taught are C++ and Python.

The reason for this is because their fundamentals are similar. You may read elsewhere that their philosphies, popularity, ease of use, typical application, or other characteristics differ, and those sources would be correct. They are different languages used differently, but they are still share similar basics.

## Great, So How Do I Start?

Set up for coding *can* be a little tricky. Once upon a time, it was actually the biggest hurdle that tended to stop people from starting. Luckily, there are soultions to that at this point. In order to make things work for people on any operating system and to keep the setup complexity lower, this guide will be using Visual Studio Code. This is a program from Microsoft that gives people an nice way to make more programs. These kinds of programs are commonly known as Integrated Developer Environments (IDEs). There are many out there for different purposes, but this one is works generally everywhere for most languages.

Before getting right into the setup of your coding environment, it might be necissary to learn a little about your *system* environment, meaning the actual computer that you are using. It may not surprise you to learn that setting up coding tools can verified and configured when you are interacting with your computer most directly. This is the intimidating part that I spoke about before. But don't worry, it's not too bad.

Most computers have programs called *shells*. In a similar vein to IDEs, shells are programs that help a user interact directly with their system. And like IDEs, there are many out there with different features, but their overall goal is the same. Windows has 2 primary shells; the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and PowerShell. PowerShell is a little nicer to use extensively. macOS and Linux can use a variety of shells, but the historically classic one is *bash*. On macOS and Ubuntu (a type of Linux operating system), they are both commonly under the Terminal app.

Super nerds could correct me on the details. But if you can correct me on the details, chances are you don't need this guide :p.

I would go and familiarize yourself with the **most** basic functions of your respective shells (depending on what operating system you are learning). Nothing more than figuring out how to open it, and maybe light navigation from folder to folder when you are in it. The idea of this is to just know that it's there and certain programming-centric things are done very easily with those programs. And, by all means, if you are interested in learning about using them to manage your computer, *go and learn*. They are very powerful tools which are incredibly rewarding to be able to wield, as well as give true insight into how your computer works. Personally, *I would rather use the shells to teach you how to program*. This guide is being written straight inside of a shell. Unfortunately, most people are more interested in learning the basics of code first before they are interested in using thier own system, and learning the how to use manage a command line before you create something of you own bores people.

In using Visual Studio code, you will be able to stay away from heavy project management all inside of a shell, and instead be introduced gently to the shell.

So, without further adieu:

1. ![Download][vsc-download-page] the corresponding version of Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSC) for your operating system.
2. ![Follow][vsc-c++-setup] this guide to setup the ability to use C++ in VSC. Complete through to the '[Hello World][https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_hello-world] step. It will give you the classic introduction to coding in C++.
3. ![Follow][] this guide to setup the ability to use Python in VSC. Complete through to the '[Run Python Code][https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python#_run-python-code]' step. It will give you the classic introduction to coding in Python.

You may have noticed that the classic intoduction to coding is the same in both languages. In fact, it's the same in all languages. The 'Hello World' program *should* be trivial to perform in any coding language. This actually isn't the case for some langauges whose programming paradigm is more advanced.

This should be everything you need to get started.

Remember, this is a living guide. If anything isn't straight forward, or something doesn't make sense, feel free to [email][email] me. (I infact *expect* this to lack clarity... so don't hesitate).
